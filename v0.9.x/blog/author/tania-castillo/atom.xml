&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some minor adjustments to the last PR I submitted. Last time it was a draft since I was waiting for the weekly meeting to know how to proceed, but now it is ready. I am waiting for the review so I can make the necessary corrections and adjustments to merge this first PR soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I receive feedback, I will continue to work on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;PR #791&lt;/a&gt; and make adjustments and changes as needed. That said, I will start working on another part of the project, which is the visualization of uncertainty. Without going into details (for now) what I have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a double_cone or dti_uncertainty actor. I’m going to work on the double cone made also with raymarching and SDF, since the implementation is pretty much the same as the ellipsoid I already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a function that returns the level of the uncertainty given by the angle of the uncertainty cone we want to visualize. For this I need to double-check the maths behind the uncertainty calculation to make sure I’m getting the right results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, but one of the things that were mentioned in the last meeting is that we should try to simplify the shader code as much as we can, that is, to break down the entire implementation into simple and easy-to-understand lines of code, which also allows the definition of functions that can be reused later on. I need to keep working on this, so I can make my code even more readable and fit the new shader structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 1: Ellipsoid actor implemented with SDF</title>

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;PR #791: Ellipsoid actor implemented with SDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a first PR with the implementation of the ellipsoid actor defined with a SDF using raymarching. The current &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/c2e5151e5f0d676501c0aee9f476d9d292cadc61/fury/actor.py#L3537"&gt;sdf&lt;/a&gt; actor allows the creation of ellipsoids, but it lacks control over their shape, and the displayed direction does not match the intended orientation. For this reason, a new actor just focused on ellipsoids was made, this one is defined by its axes (3x3 orthogonal matrix) and their corresponding lengths (3x1 vector), along with other attributes like color, opacity, and scale. The goal is to make an implementation that allows displaying a large amount of data, with good visual quality, and without compromising performance. I’m still working on this but here is a first glance of how it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/244503195-a626718f-4a13-4275-a2b7-6773823e553c.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/244503195-a626718f-4a13-4275-a2b7-6773823e553c.png" style="width: 376px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be used later to create the tensor ellipsoids used on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/c2e5151e5f0d676501c0aee9f476d9d292cadc61/fury/actor.py#L1172"&gt;tensor_slicer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to talk to my mentors first but the idea is to start making improvements on the SDF definition and raymarching algorithm, I have already started looking for information about how I can do it, and if I get good ideas, I will compare if there is an improvement in performance respect to the implementation I have right now. I also need to keep working on tests, the most common way of doing it is to check the number of objects and colors displayed, but I would like to test other things related to performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet, I need to get feedback first to see if there is anything I need to review or correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 0: Community Bounding Period</title>

&lt;h2&gt;GSoC 2023: Community Bonding Period&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, my name is Tania Castillo, I am close to finishing my degree in Computer Science and I think this is a great opportunity to put my learning and skills into practice. I will be working with FURY on improving the visualization of DTI tensors and HARDI ODFs glyphs by using well-known techniques in computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the community bonding period, I had the opportunity to get to know better GSoC mentors and former contributors. I also had the first meeting with FURY mentors where I got to learn more about the dynamic of the program, important things to keep in mind while coding, and suggestions when making the PRs. We also receive some details on how to work with shaders which is something I have to take into account since I will use them to develop part of the project. In addition, I’ve been working on the first part of the project which consists of the creation of tensor ellipsoids using the raymarching technique and SDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the advances I managed to make are in their most basic stage, I will be working this week on making changes and adjusting details for the implementation to follow FURY guidelines. In this way, I plan to submit my first PR for the project to start getting feedback and making improvements. I will also start working on the first tests for the ellipsoid actor I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, everything is going well, although I know I will probably run into some problems when reviewing and adjusting my code. We will see later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
