Hello and welcome to my second weekly check-in, I will be sharing my progress for the first week of coding.

What did you do this week?
--------------------------
This week my objective was to create the skeleton model for ComboBox2D UI element along with its required sub-components and their respective default callbacks. So far, I have successfully been able to implement them. Apart from some issues that I was facing regarding the sizing and position of the sub-components.

What is coming up next week?
----------------------------
Next week, my main focus will be on fixing the sizing issue and I will also be working on respective default and specialized class methods required by the component and its sub-components for proper functioning. I will also create tests for the same.

Did you get stuck anywhere?
---------------------------
The main problem that I faced while coding the UI element was regarding the sizing and positioning of the sub-components. The sub-components appeared flipped and the TextBlock2D element had no option to resize based on a particular width & height definition.

As you can see, the ComboBox UI element doesn't look the way its supposed to. Along with this issue the scrollbars callback doesn't work either. Hopefully, I will be able to get these issues fixed by next week.
