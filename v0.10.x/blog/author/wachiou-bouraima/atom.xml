&lt;p&gt;Helloüëãüèæ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024 journey!
This week has been filled with progress and challenges as I continue to work on modernizing the FURY code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="applying-the-keyword-only-decorator"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applying the keyword_only decorator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main task this week was to apply the keyword_only decorator to several functions.
The decorator ensures that all arguments except the first are keyword-only,
which helps to make the code clearer and parameter passing more explicit.
Some warnings appeared after applying this decorator, and to resolve them,
I updated all the code where these functions were called with the necessary format. This was a very important step in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="managing-the-challenges-of-git-rebasing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing the challenges of Git rebasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebasing the branch I was working on was the other major activity of my week.
It was a real challenge because of the conflicts that arose and had to be resolved.
It involved a lot of research and problem-solving on how to resolve these conflicts,
which greatly enhanced my understanding of Git. It was a challenging but satisfying experience of version control management and complex mergers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="peer-code-review"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peer code review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my duties, I was also tasked with reviewing the code of my peers.
This exercise was very rewarding, as it enabled me to understand different coding styles and approaches.
The constructive comments and suggestions were beneficial not only for teammates,
but also for improving my own coding and reviewing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="acknowledgements"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all my classmates: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/itellaetxe"&gt;I√±igo Tellaetxe Elorriaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/robinroy03"&gt;Robin Roy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deka27"&gt;Kaustav Deka&lt;/a&gt; and my guide: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com//skoudoro"&gt;Serge Koudoro&lt;/a&gt; for their constructive suggestions on my work.
Their ideas and suggestions were of great help to me and I am grateful for their support and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-happens-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a summary of what I plan to do in week two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply the keyword_only decorator to all other necessary functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update the calling of these functions in the code to ensure consistency and avoid raising warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rename the decorator with a more descriptive name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add two parameters to the decorator, specifying from which version of FURY it will work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü•∞Thanks for reading! Your comments are most welcome, and I look forward to giving you a sneak preview of my work next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>WEEK 0: The beginning of my journey in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024</title>

&lt;section id="here-we-go"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here we go‚Ä¶..&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Hello and welcome to my GSoC 24 journey, I‚Äôm Wachiou Bouraima pronounced (Wasiu Ibrahima).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;First of all, I‚Äôd like to express my deep gratitude for this immense opportunity.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;In this first article, yes you read ‚Äúfirst article‚Äù correctly, as it won‚Äôt be the only one, I‚Äôm going to share with you my first adventures in GSoC‚Äô24. Happy read&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="welcome-and-integration-into-the-community"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome and integration into the community.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any good start, this week I have the incredible opportunity to be welcomed into the community by the Core Team and my Mentor himself, during this session the Mentors welcomed us warmly and also congratulated us. They shared with us the rules respected during and after the GSoC program. This session made me feel comfortable and confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to admit that the mentors are experienced and willing to share their knowledge, which I really appreciate. I also got to know the DIPY and FURY community members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but I also attended the GSoC‚Äô24 summit organised by Google. This session was very informative and aimed to ease our way into GSoC‚Äô24, and help us avoid certain mistakes during and after the program.
I was able to meet the other GSoC students, and I must say that they are all very talented and motivated. I am very happy to be part of this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="project-details"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will work on the project: &lt;strong&gt;Modernization of the FURY code base to improve readability, maintainability and performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to modernize the FURY code base by implementing keyword-only arguments to improve code clarity and explicit parameter passing. In addition, the integration of lazy loading functionality will optimize performance by loading resources only when they are needed. Finally, active participation in code refactoring efforts will improve the structure and maintainability of the FURY code base. The project will result in a modernized code base, comprehensive unit testing, updated Sphinx documentation and public presentations illustrating the improvements and benefits. Ultimately, the aim is to significantly improve the FURY code base for future developers and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="weekly-tasks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekly tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to work on my first mission of the adventure, which was to create a decorator named &lt;strong&gt;keyword_only&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure that all arguments after the first are keyword arguments only. It also checks that all keyword arguments are expected by the function. You can check what I had to do in this Pull Request : &lt;a class="github reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/888"&gt;fury-gl/fury#888&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôve learned a lot from implementing the &lt;strong&gt;keyword_only&lt;/strong&gt; decorator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-s-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What‚Äôs next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my next task, I‚Äôll first apply the advice and comments from my first task, adding the &lt;strong&gt;keyword_only&lt;/strong&gt; decorator after all the necessary reviews and member approval, on all the functions concerned next, then I‚Äôll start and finish, integrating the lazy loading feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü•∞ Thank you for reading. Your comments are most welcome, and I learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
