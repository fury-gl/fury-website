==============================
Timeline and setting keyframes
==============================

In his tutorial, you will learn how to use Fury ``Timeline`` for playing the
animations.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-18

What is ``Timeline``?
=====================

``Timeline`` is responsible for handling the playback of Fury Animations.

``Timeline`` has playback methods such as ``play``, ``pause``, ``stop``, ...
which can be used to control the animation.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-24

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy as np

    from fury import actor, window
    from fury.animation import Animation, Timeline


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

We create our ``Scene`` and ``ShowManager`` as usual.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-31

.. code-block:: Python

    scene = window.Scene()

    showm = window.ShowManager(scene, size=(900, 768))
    showm.initialize()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-37

Creating a ``Timeline``
=======================

FURY ``Timeline`` has the option to attaches a very useful panel for
controlling the animation by setting ``playback_panel=True``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-40

Creating a ``Timeline`` with a PlaybackPanel.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-42

.. code-block:: Python

    timeline = Timeline(playback_panel=True)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Creating a Fury Animation as usual

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-51

.. code-block:: Python

    anim = Animation()
    sphere = actor.sphere(np.zeros([1, 3]), np.ones([1, 3]))
    anim.add_actor(sphere)
    # Now that the actor is add to the ``Animation``, setting keyframes to the
    # Animation will animate the actor accordingly.



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-60

Setting Keyframes
=================

There are multiple ways to set keyframes:

1- To set a single keyframe, you may use ``animation.set_<property>(t, k)``,
where <property> is the name of the property to be set. I.e. setting position
to (1, 2, 3) at time 0.0 would be as following:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-62

.. code-block:: Python

    anim.set_position(0.0, np.array([1, 2, 3]))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-67

Supported properties are: **position, rotation, scale, color, and opacity**.

2- To set multiple keyframes at once, you may use
``animation.set_<property>_keyframes(keyframes)``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-71

.. code-block:: Python

    keyframes = {1.0: np.array([0, 0, 0]), 3.0: np.array([-2, 0, 0])}

    anim.set_position_keyframes(keyframes)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-73

That's it! Now we are done setting keyframes.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 75-77

In order to control this animation by the timeline we created earlier, this
animation must be added to the timeline.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

.. code-block:: Python

    timeline.add_animation(anim)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-82

Now we add only the ``Timeline`` to the ``ShowManager`` the same way we add
``Animation`` to the ``ShowManager``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-92

.. code-block:: Python

    showm.add_animation(timeline)

    scene.set_camera(position=(0, 0, -10))

    interactive = False

    if interactive:
        showm.start()

    window.record(scene, out_path="viz_keyframe_animation_timeline.png", size=(900, 768))
