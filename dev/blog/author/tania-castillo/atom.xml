&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told to refactor some parts of the uncertainty PR, since I was relying too much on &lt;strong&gt;dipy&lt;/strong&gt; functions which is not good because it makes maintenance more difficult as &lt;strong&gt;dipy&lt;/strong&gt; requires &lt;strong&gt;FURY&lt;/strong&gt; for some functionalities. So I did some adjustments on the uncertainty function parameters and the corresponding tests, hopefully I managed to get with the most appropriate definition but I need to receive a first feedback to see how much I have to adjust the implementation. As I had to delete some relevant code lines inside the uncertainty calculation which consisted of preprocessing the data in order to define the necessary variables for the uncertainty formula, I was also suggested to make a tutorial of this new feature, so I can explain in detail how to obtain and adjust the necessary information, before passing it to the actor, and in general how and what is the purpose of this new function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also continued working on the ellipsoid tutorial, which I hope to finish this week so that I can ask for a first revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will finish defining some details of the tutorial so that it is ready for review, and now I will start working on the tutorial related to the uncertainty, while I receive feedback on the other PRs. Also, as preparation for the next step I will start exploring on how to address visualization of spherical harmonics for ODF glyphs visualization, I found that a previous GSoC participant at FURY started working on that and also did several work with raymarching and SDF (&lt;span class="xref std std-doc"&gt;here is a summary of the work&lt;/span&gt;), so I will take a deeper look on that to see if I can get something useful I can start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not this week, but I foresee some problems with the uncertainty PR, we will see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 6: First draft of the Ellipsoid tutorial</title>

&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/818"&gt;#PR 818: Tutorial on using ellipsoid actor to visualize tensor ellipsoids for DTI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the PR for the tutorial that will show the use that can be made of the &lt;em&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/em&gt; actor in the visualization of diffusion tensor ellipsoids. It is still in its most basic stage, but the structure that I have thought of for now consists of: displaying a slice using &lt;em&gt;tensor_slicer&lt;/em&gt; with spheres of 100, 200, and 724 vertices, and using &lt;em&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/em&gt; actor, and show a comparison of the visual quality of the tensor ellipsoids. Then, display a ROI using both actors and a whole brain using the &lt;em&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/em&gt; actor, to show that this new actor gives the possibility to display more data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also submitted the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/810"&gt;uncertainty PR&lt;/a&gt; for review, in order to start making the necessary corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;#PR 791&lt;/a&gt; to be merged first, but meanwhile, I will start working on the explanation of the tutorial, since I already have the code structure and the idea of what I want to illustrate. I will discuss further work with my mentors at the upcoming meeting, so I can organize myself better and plan how I’m going to address the pending parts of my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found no major difficulties this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week 5: Preparing the data for the Ellipsoid tutorial</title>

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the weekly meeting with my mentors, there was a small discussion over the naming of the actor and its usage. On the one hand, although the purpose of the actor is to visualize diffusion tensor ellipsoids, the idea is that it can also be used for any other type of visualization that requires the use of ellipsoids, so in the end, we decided to keep the name &lt;em&gt;ellipsoid&lt;/em&gt; as it is more generic. On the other hand, as there is already an actor made for the purpose of tensor visualization, namely &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/e595bad0246899d58d24121dcc291eb050721f9f/fury/actor.py#L1172"&gt;tensor_slicer&lt;/a&gt;, it might not be obvious how and why one would use this new ellipsoid actor for this purpose, thus it was proposed to make a tutorial that can clarify this. The main difference between both actors relies on the quality and the amount of data that can be displayed, so the idea is to show the difference between both alternatives so the user can choose which one to use depending on their needs. To prepare the tutorial the first step was to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury-data/pull/12"&gt;add the data&lt;/a&gt; I will use on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury-data"&gt;fury-data&lt;/a&gt; so I can then fetch and load the datasets I need to work on the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;#PR 791&lt;/a&gt; to be reviewed by my GSoC fellows at FURY, so I will address their comments, and additionally make adjustments on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/810"&gt;#PR 810&lt;/a&gt; based on the feedback I receive. I will also start working on the tutorial, the idea is to show the use that can be made of the ellipsoid actor in the visualization of diffusion tensor ellipsoids, compared to the &lt;em&gt;tensor_slicer&lt;/em&gt; actor. I plan to create a WIP PR to start getting feedback on the general structure of the tutorial and the way everything will be explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not encounter any obstacles this week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Week 4: First draft of the DTI uncertainty visualization</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-4-first-draft-of-the-dti-uncertainty-visualization"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/810"&gt;#PR 810: DTI uncertainty visualization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a second PR with the implementation of DTI uncertainty calculation and visualization. Below is an image of diffusion tensor ellipsoids and their associated uncertainty cones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/254747296-09a8674e-bfc0-4b3f-820f-8a1b1ad8c5c9.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/254747296-09a8674e-bfc0-4b3f-820f-8a1b1ad8c5c9.png" style="width: 530px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to use some &lt;strong&gt;dipy&lt;/strong&gt; functions, specifically: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dipy/dipy/blob/321e06722ef42b5add3a7f570f6422845177eafa/dipy/denoise/noise_estimate.py#L272"&gt;estimate_sigma&lt;/a&gt; for the noise variance calculation, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dipy/dipy/blob/321e06722ef42b5add3a7f570f6422845177eafa/dipy/reconst/dti.py#L2112"&gt;design_matrix&lt;/a&gt; to get the b-matrix, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dipy/dipy/blob/321e06722ef42b5add3a7f570f6422845177eafa/dipy/reconst/dti.py#L639"&gt;tensor_prediction&lt;/a&gt; for the signal estimation. The details of this calculations can be found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.21111"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue working on the uncertainty PR which is still in its early stage, I’m going to make a couple of adjustments to the description of the parameters and the actor, and keep working on based on the feedback I receive. There are also minor details to be discussed with my mentors about the first PR, which I hope to finish refining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to make the PR because I had some problems with the uncertainty function definition. I tried to use the least amount of parameters for the function, since with data, bvals and bvecs it is possible to obtain the rest of the parameters needed to generate the cones, which led me to readjust some calculations from the base implementation I had, to keep everything working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 3: Working on uncertainty and details of the first PR</title>

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some adjustments to the ellipsoid actor definition, now called &lt;em&gt;tensor&lt;/em&gt;. This was something discussed in the weekly meeting as the coming changes are related to this actor, the idea now is to have a tensor actor that allows choosing between displaying the tensor ellipsoids or the uncertainty cones (later on). I also worked on the uncertainty calculation, and the cone SDF for the visualization, so I plan to do a WIP PR next to start getting feedback on this new addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the uncertainty calculation, other data is needed such as the noise variance and the design matrix (check &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.21111"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article for more details), I need to identify which should be the parameters for the function definition. I also have to work on the documentation, so the function and its purpose are clear. I plan to make some final adjustments related to the uncertainty so that the next PR is ready for submission this week. I also expect to make final changes to the first PR so that it can be merged soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not this week, I will wait for feedback to see if there is anything I need to review or correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 2: Making adjustments to the Ellipsoid Actor</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-2-making-adjustments-to-the-ellipsoid-actor"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some minor adjustments to the last PR I submitted. Last time it was a draft since I was waiting for the weekly meeting to know how to proceed, but now it is ready. I am waiting for the review so I can make the necessary corrections and adjustments to merge this first PR soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I receive feedback, I will continue to work on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;PR #791&lt;/a&gt; and make adjustments and changes as needed. That said, I will start working on another part of the project, which is the visualization of uncertainty. Without going into details (for now) what I have to do is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a double_cone or dti_uncertainty actor. I’m going to work on the double cone made also with raymarching and SDF, since the implementation is pretty much the same as the ellipsoid I already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a function that returns the level of the uncertainty given by the angle of the uncertainty cone we want to visualize. For this I need to double-check the maths behind the uncertainty calculation to make sure I’m getting the right results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly, but one of the things that were mentioned in the last meeting is that we should try to simplify the shader code as much as we can, that is, to break down the entire implementation into simple and easy-to-understand lines of code, which also allows the definition of functions that can be reused later on. I need to keep working on this, so I can make my code even more readable and fit the new shader structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 1: Ellipsoid actor implemented with SDF</title>

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/791"&gt;PR #791: Ellipsoid actor implemented with SDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a first PR with the implementation of the ellipsoid actor defined with a SDF using raymarching. The current &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/c2e5151e5f0d676501c0aee9f476d9d292cadc61/fury/actor.py#L3537"&gt;sdf&lt;/a&gt; actor allows the creation of ellipsoids, but it lacks control over their shape, and the displayed direction does not match the intended orientation. For this reason, a new actor just focused on ellipsoids was made, this one is defined by its axes (3x3 orthogonal matrix) and their corresponding lengths (3x1 vector), along with other attributes like color, opacity, and scale. The goal is to make an implementation that allows displaying a large amount of data, with good visual quality, and without compromising performance. I’m still working on this but here is a first glance of how it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/244503195-a626718f-4a13-4275-a2b7-6773823e553c.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/244503195-a626718f-4a13-4275-a2b7-6773823e553c.png" style="width: 376px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be used later to create the tensor ellipsoids used on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/blob/c2e5151e5f0d676501c0aee9f476d9d292cadc61/fury/actor.py#L1172"&gt;tensor_slicer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to talk to my mentors first but the idea is to start making improvements on the SDF definition and raymarching algorithm, I have already started looking for information about how I can do it, and if I get good ideas, I will compare if there is an improvement in performance respect to the implementation I have right now. I also need to keep working on tests, the most common way of doing it is to check the number of objects and colors displayed, but I would like to test other things related to performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not yet, I need to get feedback first to see if there is anything I need to review or correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GSoC 2023: Community Bonding Period&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, my name is Tania Castillo, I am close to finishing my degree in Computer Science and I think this is a great opportunity to put my learning and skills into practice. I will be working with FURY on improving the visualization of DTI tensors and HARDI ODFs glyphs by using well-known techniques in computer graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the community bonding period, I had the opportunity to get to know better GSoC mentors and former contributors. I also had the first meeting with FURY mentors where I got to learn more about the dynamic of the program, important things to keep in mind while coding, and suggestions when making the PRs. We also receive some details on how to work with shaders which is something I have to take into account since I will use them to develop part of the project. In addition, I’ve been working on the first part of the project which consists of the creation of tensor ellipsoids using the raymarching technique and SDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the advances I managed to make are in their most basic stage, I will be working this week on making changes and adjusting details for the implementation to follow FURY guidelines. In this way, I plan to submit my first PR for the project to start getting feedback and making improvements. I will also start working on the first tests for the ellipsoid actor I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, everything is going well, although I know I will probably run into some problems when reviewing and adjusting my code. We will see later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
