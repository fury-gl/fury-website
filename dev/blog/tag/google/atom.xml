&lt;section id="what-did-you-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did you do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week, I initiated my work on the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; PR, which had been started by Soham. The initial version of the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/294"&gt;#294&lt;/a&gt;. To start, I focused on rebasing the PR. Since this PR was based on an older version, there were some updates to the overall UI structure that needed to be addressed for compatibility. While handling this, I identified a set of issues that I documented in the current PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/832"&gt;#832&lt;/a&gt;. These mainly revolved around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resizing &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and related components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rectifying the text overflow problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with a &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing the positioning of items in the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ListBox2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I systematically approached each of these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resizing FileMenu and Related Components:&lt;/strong&gt; This was a fairly complex task since it involved intricate dependencies, such as the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; relying on the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileMenu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which, in turn, was dependent on &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ListBox2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;Panel2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; resizing. To make the process manageable, I decided to progress incrementally in a separate PR a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Overflow Issue:&lt;/strong&gt; The problem with text overflow was rooted in our previous approach, which involved executing these actions only when the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; had a scene property. Although this approach suited the previous version of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, the recent refactoring led to the removal of this property. The scene was previously utilized to determine the text actor’s size. However, we had new methodologies to calculate these sizes, which are detailed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/803"&gt;#803&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Text Overflow Before" class="align-center" src="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/assets/64432063/b001f9d3-a5e8-45ad-8605-85df595b5654" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Text Overflow After" class="align-center" src="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/assets/64432063/d3c9c3a3-e601-45ab-8975-2b1e98acf1d3" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing ZeroDivisionError:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ZeroDivisionError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; emerged when the total number of values was the same as the number of slots. The issue lay in the separation of these values for calculating the scrollbar’s height parameter. Unfortunately, this calculation error occurred when this would return us zero while updating the scrollbar. To counter this, I implemented a conditional check to ascertain whether the value is zero or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correcting ``ListBox2D`` Item Positioning:&lt;/strong&gt; Another challenge I encountered related to the improper positioning of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ListBox2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; item’s background. When a slot was not visible, its background was resized to zero, and visibility was set to off. Consequently, during the calculation of updated positions, the height was considered zero, leading to mispositioning. I resolved this by refraining from resizing and solely toggling visibility, achieving the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="ListBox2D mispositioning Before" class="align-center" src="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/assets/64432063/e2805934-b037-47fd-872c-0b284b298d3c" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Fixed ListBox2D mispositioning" class="align-center" src="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/assets/64432063/3bc1aabb-bb79-4e26-817d-a2a2ddd20ea3" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-you-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did you get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the challenges I faced, one notable instance involved addressing the visibility issue in &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TreeUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Despite my attempts at various solutions, none yielded the desired outcome. The &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TreeUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; exhibited either full visibility or no visibility at all. In this situation, I sought guidance from my mentor to find a viable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; implementation is nearly finalized, and my plan is to work on any review, feedback or suggestions that might arise. Following this, I will shift my attention towards addressing the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TreeUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 11 : Adjusting ODF implementation and looking for solutions on issues found</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-11-adjusting-odf-implementation-and-looking-for-solutions-on-issues-found"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to experiment with the ODF glyph implementation. Thanks to one of my mentors I figured out how to get the missing data corresponding to the SH coefficients &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(a^l_m\)&lt;/span&gt; part of the function &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(f(\theta, \phi)\)&lt;/span&gt; described &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dipy.org/documentation/1.7.0/theory/sh_basis/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I also was told to make sure to implement the correct SH basis since there are different definitions from the literature, I have to focus now in the one proposed by Descoteaux, described in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.21277"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;, which is labeled in &lt;em&gt;dipy&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;descoteaux07&lt;/em&gt;. To do this I had to make a small adjustment to the base implementation that I took as a reference, from which I obtained a first result using SH of order 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260909561-fd90033c-018a-465b-bd16-3586bb31ca36.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260909561-fd90033c-018a-465b-bd16-3586bb31ca36.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that the results on the shape are about the same, except for the direction, but there is still work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, there are 3 things I will continue to work on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color and lighting. As these objects present curvatures with quite a bit of detail in some cases, this is something that requires more specific lighting work, in addition to having now not only one color but a color map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scaling. This is something I still don’t know how to deal with. I had to adjust it manually for now, but the idea is to find a relationship between the coefficients and the final object size so it can be automatically scaled, or maybe there is a proper way to pre-process this data before passing it to the shaders to get the right result at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/runner/work/fury/fury/docs/source/posts/2023/2023-08-16-week-11-tvcastillod.rst&lt;/span&gt;, line 2); &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="#id1"&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate explicit target name: “here”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to pass the information of the coefficients efficiently. Right now I’m creating one actor per glyph since I’m using a uniform array to pass the coefficients, but the idea is to pass all the data at once. I found several ideas &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7954927/passing-a-list-of-values-to-fragment-shader"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of how to pass a list of values to the fragment shader directly, I just need to explore deeper how this can be done on &lt;strong&gt;FURY&lt;/strong&gt;, and see which option is most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the points mentioned above are things that I tried to fix, however, it is something that I need to look at in much more detail and that I know is going to take me some time to understand and test before I get to the expected result. I hope to get some ideas from my mentors and fellow GSoC contributors on how I can proceed to deal with each of the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 11: A Refactor is Sometimes Needed</title>
    <updated>2023-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-11-a-refactor-is-sometimes-needed"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, it’s time for another weekly blogpost! Today I am going to share some updates on the API refactoring
I was working on with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="last-week-s-effort"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Week’s Effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I shared with you &lt;span class="xref std std-doc"&gt;last week&lt;/span&gt;, the first draft of my API was finally ready for review, as
I finished tweaking some remaining details missing. I was tasked with finding a good example of the usage of the tools we proposed,
and I started to do that, however after testing it with some examples, I figured out some significant bugs were to be fixed. Also,
after some reviews and hints from some of my mentors and other GSoC contributors, we realised that some refactoring should be done,
mainly focused on avoiding bad API usage from the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="so-how-did-it-go"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how did it go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought only one bug was the source of the issues the rendering presented, but it turned out to be two, which I will
explain further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bug was related to scaling and misalignment of the KDE render. The render of the points being post-processed was not only
with sizes different from the original set size, but it was also misaligned, making it appear in positions different from the points’
original ones. After some time spent, I figured out the bug was related to the texture coordinates I was using. Before, this is how
my fragment shader looked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight-C notranslate"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res_factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tex_coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res_factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normalizedVertexMCVSOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;intensity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;screenTexture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tex_coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out using this texture coordinates for &lt;em&gt;this case&lt;/em&gt; was not the best choice, as even though it matches the fragment positions,
the idea here was to render the offscreen window, which has the same size as the onscreen one, to the billboard actor. With that in mind,
I realised the best choice was using texture coordinates that matched the whole screen positions, coordinates that were derived from the
&lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;gl_FragCoord.xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, being the division of that by the resolution of the screen, for normalization. Below, the change made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight-C notranslate"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vec2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tex_coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gl_FragCoord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;intensity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;texture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;screenTexture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tex_coords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change worked initially, although with some problems, that later revealed the resolution of the offscreen window needed to be
updated inside the callback function as well. Fixing that, it was perfectly aligned and scaled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second bug was related with the handling of the bandwidth, former sigma parameter. I realised I wasn’t dealing properly with the option of the user passing only
one single bandwidth value being passed, so when trying that, only the first point was being rendered. I also fixed that and it worked,
so cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I previously said, the bugs were not the only details I spent my time on last week. Being reviewed, the API design, even
though simple, showed itself vulnerable to bad usage from the user side, requiring some changes. The changes suggested by mentors were,
to, basically, take the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;kde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; method out of the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;EffectManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; class, and create a new class from it inside an &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; module,
like it was a special effects class. With this change, the KDE setup would go from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight-python notranslate"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EffectManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;kde_actor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kde&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;show_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kde_actor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight-python notranslate"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EffectManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;show_manager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;kde_effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;em&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kde_effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a gain in line shortening, however, a gain in security, as preventing users from misusing the kde_actor. Something worth noting is
that I learned how to use the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;functools.partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; function, that allowed me to partially call the callback function with only some
parameters passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that refactoring made, now I am awaiting for a second review so we could finally wrap it up and merge the first stage of this API.
With that being done, I will write the final report and wrap this all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 11: Bye Bye SpinBox</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-11-bye-bye-spinbox"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-you-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did you do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building upon the progress of the previous week, a major milestone was reached with the merging of PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/830"&gt;#830&lt;/a&gt;. This PR added essential “getters” and “setters” for the new features of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, making it easier to handle changes. This, in turn, facilitated the integration of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the updated &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while working on &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, a critical issue emerged. As &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows users to input characters and symbols into an editable textbox, it posed a risk of program crashes due to invalid inputs. To counter this, I introduced a validation check to ensure that the input was a valid number. If valid, the input was converted; otherwise, it reverted to the previous value. After thorough testing and review, PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/499"&gt;#499&lt;/a&gt; was successfully merged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="SpinBoxUI" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64432063/261409747-511e535b-185c-4e70-aaa8-5296c93e5344.gif" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a concern with the textbox’s behavior was identified when &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was scaled to a larger size. Specifically, the text occasionally touched the top or bottom boundary, creating an overflow appearance. Although initial solutions were attempted, the complexity of the issue required further consideration. This issue has been documented in more detail in Issue &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/838"&gt;#838&lt;/a&gt;, where it is marked as a low-priority item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="TextBlock2D text positioning issue" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64432063/133194003-53e2dac6-31e0-444e-b7f1-a9e71545f560.jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-you-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did you get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge of the week centered around addressing the textbox’s overflow behavior in &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the focus remains on refining the FileDialog component, as the significant progress with &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; prepares us to shift attention to other aspects of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 10 : Start of SH implementation experiments</title>
    <updated>2023-08-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-10-start-of-sh-implementation-experiments"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started formally working on SH implementation. I was told to start first doing a simple program where I can modify in real-time the order &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(l\)&lt;/span&gt; and degree &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt;, parameters corresponding to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://dipy.org/documentation/1.7.0/theory/sh_basis/"&gt;Spherical Harmonics function&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)=\)&lt;/span&gt;, based on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lenixlobo/fury/commit/2b7ce7a71fd422dc5a250d7b49e1eea2db9d3bce"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt;. That is just one part of the final ODF calculation, but here is what a first experimental script looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260910073-10b0edd4-40e3-495c-85ad-79993aef3b19.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260910073-10b0edd4-40e3-495c-85ad-79993aef3b19.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it in order to make sure it was visually correct and also to understand better how those 2 parameters are related and need to be incorporated into the final calculation. There is one issue at first sight that needs to be addressed, and that is the scaling, since for SH with a degree near 0, the object gets out of bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep polishing details from my current open PRs, hopefully, I will get another PR merged before the last GSoC week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure about how to use the current implementation I have to get similar visualizations made with &lt;em&gt;odf_slicer&lt;/em&gt;, since the parameters that the function receive are different, so I need to take a deeper look and see where it might be the connection or if I should make some adjustments on the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 10: Ready for Review!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-10-ready-for-review"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, it’s time for another weekly blogpost!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="last-week-s-effort"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Week’s Effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with my mentors, I was tasked with getting my API PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/826"&gt;#826&lt;/a&gt; ready for review,
as it still needed some polishing, and the most important of all, it needed its tests working, as this was something I haven’t invested time since its creation.
Having that in mind, I have spent the whole week cleaning whatever needed, writing the tests, and also writing a simple example of its
usage. I also tried implementing a little piece of UI so the user could control the intensity of the bandwidth of the KDE render, but
I had a little problem I will talk about below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="so-how-did-it-go"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how did it go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, for the cleaning part, I didn’t have any trouble, and my PR is finally ready for review! The most complicated part was to write the tests, as this is something that
requires attention to understand what needs to be tested, exactly. As for the UI part, I managed to have a slider working for the
intensity, however, it was crashing the whole program for a reason, so I decided to leave this idea behind for now.
Below, an example of how this should work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Buggy slider for the intensity control of the bandwidth of the KDE" class="align-center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoDell/gsoc_assets/main/images/slider.gif" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="this-week-s-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a meeting with my mentors, we decided that this week’s focus should be on finding a good usage example of the KDE rendering feature,
to have it as a showcase of the capability of this API. Also, they hinted me some changes that need to be done regarding the API, so I
will also invest some time on refactoring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-you-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did you do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, my focus shifted to the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; after wrapping up work on &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a component that allows users to select a value by spinning through a range. To ensure a smooth transition, I made adjustments in &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to align it with the recent updates in &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. To make things even clearer and more user-friendly, I initiated a continuous code improvement process. I introduced setters and getters that enable easier customization of &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;’s new features, such as &lt;strong&gt;auto_font_scale&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dynamic_bbox&lt;/strong&gt;. These tools simplify the process of adjusting these settings, and you can see the ongoing changes in pull request &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/830"&gt;#830&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, I worked on improving the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; component. Since the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;FileDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; PR was based on an older version, it required updates to match the recent developments in &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This involved restructuring the code and making sure that everything worked smoothly together. You can checkout the progress here at PR &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/832"&gt;#832&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-you-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did you get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this week was quite smooth sailing without any major roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, my plan is to finalize the integration of the updated &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;TextBlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; components. This entails making sure that everything works seamlessly together and is ready for the next stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 9: Tutorial done and polishing DTI uncertainty</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-9-tutorial-done-and-polishing-dti-uncertainty"&gt;

&lt;section id="what-did-i-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I addressed the comments from the tutorial of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fury-gl/fury/pull/818"&gt;PR #818&lt;/a&gt;  related to how to display specific visualizations I wanted to make. I was suggested to use &lt;em&gt;ShowManager&lt;/em&gt; to handle the zoom of the scene and also to use &lt;em&gt;GridUI&lt;/em&gt; to display several actors at the same time for a visual quality comparison of the tensors. Below are some images generated for the tutorial that is almost done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260906510-d422e7b4-3ba3-4de6-bfd0-09c04bec8876.png" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31288525/260906510-d422e7b4-3ba3-4de6-bfd0-09c04bec8876.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some issues with the tests of the uncertainty implementation, specifically a segmentation problem that has to be with the shaders, so I expect to correct the problem by next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-i-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still thinking about how to approach the implementation of the spherical harmonics for ODF glyphs. Most of the implementations I have found are static so my task would be to try to parametrize the existing functions, so I can pass data from Python to the shaders properly so that I can obtain the same result as the current &lt;em&gt;odf_slicer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 9: It is Polishing Time!</title>
    <updated>2023-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content type="html">&lt;section id="week-9-it-is-polishing-time"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, it’s time for another weekly blogpost! Today, I am going to update you on my project’s latest changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="last-week-s-effort"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Week’s Effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having finished a first draft of the API that will be used for the KDE rendering, and showing how it could be used
for other post-processing effects, my goal was to clean the code and try some details that would add to it so it could be better
complete. Having that in mind, I invested in three work fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing some bugs related to the rendering more than one post-processing effect actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with other rendering kernels (I was using the &lt;em&gt;gaussian&lt;/em&gt; one only).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completing the KDE render by renormalizing the values in relation to the number of points (one of the core KDE details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both three turned out more complicated than it initially seemed, as I will show below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="so-how-did-it-go"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So how did it go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I did on monday-tuesday, and I had to deal with some issues regarding scaling and repositioning. Due to implementation
choices, the final post-processed effects were rendered either bigger than they were in reality, or out of their original place.
After some time dedicated to finding the root of the problems, I could fix the scaling issue, however I realised I would need to,
probably, rethink the way the API was implemented. As this general post-processing effects is a side-project that comes as a consequence of
my main one, I decided to leave that investment to another time, as I would need to guarantee the quality of the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was an easy and rather interesting part of my week, as I just needed to setup new kernel shaders. Based on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/density.html"&gt;scikit-learn KDE documentation&lt;/a&gt;, I could successfully implement the following kernels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaussian&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = e^{\frac{-(x^2 + y^2)}{2\sigma^2}}\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tophat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = 1.0, \ \ |x^2 + y^2| &amp;lt; \sigma\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epanechnikov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = 1 - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{\sigma^2}\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exponential&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = e^{\frac{-|x^2 + y^2|}{\sigma}}\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = 1 - \frac{|x^2 + y^2|}{\sigma}, \ \ |x^2 + y^2| &amp;lt; \sigma\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[K(x, y) = cos(\frac{\pi|x^2 + y^2|}{2\sigma})\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That outputted the following (beautiful) results for a set of 1000 random points with random sigmas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Different kernel approaches" class="align-center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoDell/gsoc_assets/main/images/kernels.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third one is still being a trickier challenge. If you recall from my first blogposts, I spent something around &lt;em&gt;one month&lt;/em&gt; trying to setup
float framebuffer objects to FURY with VTK so I could use them in my project. After spending all of that time with no results,
me and Bruno, my mentor, &lt;span class="xref std std-doc"&gt;found a way&lt;/span&gt; to do what we wanted to do, but using a different VTK class,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkWindowToImageFilter.html"&gt;vtkWindowToImageFilter&lt;/a&gt;. Well, it was a good workaround back then and
it lead me all the way here, however now it is costing a price. The float framebuffers were an important part of the project because they
would allow us to pass &lt;em&gt;32-bit float information&lt;/em&gt; from one shader to another, which would be important as they would allow the densities to
have higher precision and more fidelity to the calculations. When rendering a KDE of a given set of points, we use the below function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;
\[KDE(x, y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 0}^n K(x, y)\]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the number of points &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is big enough, some KDE results will be really low. This presents a real problem to our implementation because, without
the float framebuffers, it is currently only being possible to pass &lt;em&gt;8-bit unsigned char&lt;/em&gt; information, that only allows 256 values.
This is far from ideal, as low values would have alone densities low enough to disappear. This presented a problem as to renormalize the
densities, I was retrieving the texture to the CPU, calculating its minimum and maximum values, and passing to the fragment shader as uniforms
for the renormalization, which didn’t work if the maximum values calculated were zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One solution I thought to solve that was a really heavy workaround: if an unsigned float is 32-bit and I have exactly 4 8-bit
unsigned chars, why not try to pack this float into these 4 chars? Well, this is an interesting approach which I figured out is already an
old one, being reported in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-ii-lighting-and-shadows/chapter-12-omnidirectional-shadow-mapping"&gt;GPU Gems’s chapter 12&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately I haven’t tried yet this implementation yet, and went for one I thought myself, which haven’t exactly worked. I also tried
this implementation from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aras-p.info/blog/2009/07/30/encoding-floats-to-rgba-the-final/"&gt;Aras Pranckevičius’ website&lt;/a&gt;, which seems
to be working, even though not perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Noisy float to RGBA encoding" class="align-center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoDell/gsoc_assets/main/images/noisy%20kde.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this implementation is &lt;em&gt;really noisy&lt;/em&gt;. I think this has to deal with floating point rounding errors, so to try to mitigate
that, I experimented applying a &lt;em&gt;13x13 gaussian blur&lt;/em&gt; to it. Below, what I got from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Blurred KDE result" class="align-center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoaoDell/gsoc_assets/main/images/blurred_kde.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks way better, even though not ideal yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="this-week-s-goals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with my mentors, we decided it was better if I focused on the version without the renormalization for now, as it was already
done and running fine. So for this week, I plan to clean my PR to finally have it ready for a first review, and maybe add to it a little
UI tool to control the intensity of the densities. That should take me some time and discussion, but I hope for it to be ready by the
end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Week 9: TextBlock2D is Finally Merged!</title>

&lt;section id="what-did-you-do-this-week"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did you do this week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from the previous week, it seemed like we were almost done with the &lt;em&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/em&gt;, but there remained a final task of addressing conflicting issues. Being a core part of the UI, &lt;em&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/em&gt; had a few compatibility problems with certain other UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default behavior of &lt;em&gt;TextBox2D&lt;/em&gt; now includes a dynamic bounding box, which scales automatically based on the contained text. Users can customize this option through a simple flag setting. However, this change affected some UI elements like &lt;em&gt;Combobox2d&lt;/em&gt;, which relied on the default textbox size. Consequently, I had to make updates to ensure compatibility. Additionally, the default initialization of the &lt;em&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/em&gt; was completely static, which led to the possibility of the text extending beyond the background and failing certain tests. To tackle this, I made adjustments to the overflow helper function in the &lt;em&gt;test_elements.py&lt;/em&gt; file. After a few tweaks and issue resolutions, the PR was ready for review and was successfully merged after passing the review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="TextBlock2D with different attributes" class="align-center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64432063/258603191-d540105a-0612-450e-8ae3-ca8aa87916e6.gif" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="did-you-get-stuck-anywhere"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did you get stuck anywhere?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered some peculiar test failures that were indirectly related to the &lt;em&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/em&gt; which at first glance didn’t came up. Although after some debugging and a thorough line-by-line analysis, I managed to identify and resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-coming-up-next"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is coming up next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next priority will be completing the &lt;em&gt;SpinBoxUI&lt;/em&gt; now that the &lt;em&gt;TextBlock2D&lt;/em&gt; is fixed and successfully integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
